# 2025/10/19 -> 2025/10/27 Project Ideation Phase

>This week's document describes the pre-project target. The goal is to get a head start on ideas for my final project. If nothing has changed since my last attempt this will be a software project, a video game at that. I will be able to demonstrate a working functional software artefact. While it should be playable, and publicly available, I'm not too concerned if the testers can play it.

***Approx 10 weeks until OU starts.***

# Tutor Questons
1) Is a computer game an acceptible project.
    - If yes, how do I best communicate the project?
        - Screenshots?
        - Video?
        - Code examples?
        - Playable executable file?
2) If it isn't, present 2 alternate web projects that are likely easier to demonstrate.
3) If those aren't suitable, ask for examples and ideas.

# Project 1 : Video Game
I don't know what platform to target, or what genre of game to make. I'll list a few platforms and see what excites me the most.

| Platform| Thoughts
|----| --- |
|PC| By far the easiest, can target the web for easiest access for submission. |
|Gameboy| Incredibly restrictive, but restrictions breed creativity. |
|Gameboy Advance| My partner wants to play a cool home made GBA game some day. |
|Sega Saturn | A wildcard platform that has a really cool and novel architecture.|
|Master System | A second wildcard platform that is rarely developed for. |
|PlayStation | A final wildcard platform where I know nothing about it, but it seems cool.|

|Genre| Thoughts |
|---| --- |
|RPG| Really cool, lots of maths. Typically large sprawling games. Easiest to design, largest product.|
|Puzzle| Short 5 minute game sessions typically. Hardest to design. |
|Shooter| Sits between the two above in terms of design and software complexity. A lot of advanced maths can be used.|

| Theme |
| --- |
| Fantasy |
| Science Fiction |
| Horror |
| City-Life|
| Parody |

Based on the above I need to consider the following factors into my process :
1) What can I do with my skillset.
2) What can I reasonably learn in the time it takes to develop the project.
3) Will I be able to demonstrate the development process from start to finish?

A puzzle game is a difficult thing to innovate on, not impossible but it's difficult. A role playing game and a shooter would both be good for design innovation and both fit nicely programatically. So it's really a toss-up between a role playing game and a shooter.

For the platform I need to make sure it's something I can demonstrate, I really want to target a retro gaming platform, however I know full well that it'd be difficult to demonstrate the project that way. Which is why I'm wondering if I can just write it in vanilla javascript. If I do that it'd be very easy to demonstrate on a website, such as my own private website or a github repository. It would also be in a language that's familiar for most people when reviewing the project.
I don't think it'd be hard to do in pure javascript, if it's a 2d project.

My final thoughts are that I'll develop a parody shooter for the PC that will be playable on a browser using vanilla js. I don't imagine it would be too hard in all honesty.


# Project 2 : Gamified todolist + pomodoro
It's pretty cliche to do a todolist, but I think it's a really good project to demonstrate front and back end development. This project would be a platform where users can sign up and fill tasks to level up their profile, so their todolist becomes a quest list to level up. It will be visually styled like a classic japanese RPG. There will also be a pomodoro mode where you can work on skills to level them up. 

Technologies :
- Database tools.
- Web server.
- Frontend and backend development. (HTML, CSS, JS, SQL, maybe something else for the backend.)



# Project 3 : Video Game playlist tool
I own way too many games across different platforms, it'd be nice to have a social tool where I can track my current game and update my progress over time. Similar stack to the todolist above. A user should be able to add and remove games from their library and update each game's status/progress. With a notes area that people can read. 

This would focus a lot more on database manipulation and management, then presenting that data beautifully.

Technologies are the same as project 2 (at a glance at least).
